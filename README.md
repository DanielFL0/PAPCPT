ðŸ“˜ Course Syllabus: Programming Algorithms using Parallel and Concurrent Programming Techniques (Go Edition)

Course Description:

This crash course is an intensive, hands-on introduction to concurrent and parallel programming using the Go programming language. Students will explore key paradigms such as goroutines, channels, mutexes, condition variables, wait groups, and worker pools. The course culminates in advanced applications of these tools to solve complex optimization problems using metaheuristics.

Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of programming in Go
- Understanding of algorithms and data structures

Course Duration: 8 Weeks

Learning Outcomes:

- Understand Go's concurrency model and how it differs from traditional threads
- Build robust concurrent programs using goroutines and channels
- Develop parallel algorithms using worker pools, fan-in/fan-out patterns, and synchronization primitives
- Apply parallelism to real-world problems including simulation, sorting, graph algorithms, and metaheuristics
